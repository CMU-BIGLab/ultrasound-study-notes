## **Acoustic Waves:**

- Pressure waves through medium → Sound
- Frequency → cycles of motion per second
- Sound detection → 20-20,000 HZ

## **Propagation:**

- Pressure changes of molecules transferred mechanically → Propagation
- Requires elastic medium (solid, liquid, or gas)
- Different media → different propagation

## **Compression and Rarefaction:**

## **Basic Nomenclature:**

- Wavelength
- Frequency
- Amplitude
- Acoustic Velocity

## **Acoustic Velocity Determinants:**

- Density
- Compressibility
- [Bulk modulus](Terms/Bulk%20modulus.md)

## **Acoustic Velocity:**

- Increased density → Decreased AV
- Increased compressibility → Decreased AV
- Soft Tissue → 1540 m/s

## **Velocity in One Medium:**

- Wavelength → inversely proportional to frequency (λ = 1/f)

## **Velocity in Soft Tissue:**

- Similar in most soft tissues: ~1.54 millimeters/μs

## **Intensity:**

- Linear beam propagation → change in intensity → no effect on frequency, wavelength, and acoustic velocity.

## **Interactions of Acoustic Waves with Tissue:**

- Foundation of Ultrasound → different ways the sound beam interferes with the tissues.
1. Reflection
2. Scatter
3. Refraction
4. Diffraction
5. Interference
6. Absorption: The combined effect of *scattering* and *absorption* is called *attenuation*.

## **Specular Reflection vs Diffuse Reflection:**

## **Reflection:**

[Reflection](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Reflection.csv)

## **Reflection and Transmission:**

## **Refraction:**

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image5.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image5.png)

## **Diffraction (Divergence):**

- Occurs when passing through a small opening.
- Beam spreads out as it moves farther from a point source.

## **Interference:**

- Constructive → increase in amplitude.
- It is used to focus the beams to a certain depth.

## **Absorption:**

- Sound energy dissipated in a medium
- Therapeutic purposes!

## **Attenuation:**

- Overall effect of scatter and absorption
- Depth of beam penetration
- The attenuation rate is proportional to the square of the frequency.

## **Time Gain Compensation (TGC):**

- Returned signals are amplified as a function of their depth.

## **Attenuation Coefficients:**

## **Transducers-Transmission:**

- [Piezoelectric effect](Terms/Piezoelectric%20effect.md)

## **Gain:**

- Transmission gain → increased → stronger received signal

## **Tissue Harmonic Imaging:**

- Integral multiples of the center frequency.
- Improved contrast resolution.
- Reduced artifacts (side lobes, reverberations).

## **Lobe Artifacts:**

### Side Lobes

- Secondary projections of ultrasound energy

### Grating Lobes

- Just like side lobes that have same amplitude as main beam and are unintended and creates interference with main lobes, so it might limit our system performance.

## Pulsed Wave Output:

- Transducer sends a pulse of sound waves → waits → then listens.
- Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) → Rate of pulses per second.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image9.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image9.png)

## **Spatial Pulse Length:**

- The distance that a pulse occupies in space.
- Distance from the start to the end of one pulse.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image10.jpeg](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image10.jpeg)

## **Resolution:**

- Axial (x): Resolution along the direction of the ultrasound beam.
- Lateral (y): Transverse (lateral) resolution is the resolution at right angles to the beam direction.
- Elevational (Z), (Slice Thickness): Slice thickness relates to the width of the beam in the non-imaging plane and governs the thickness of the slice of tissue being imaged.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%201.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%201.png)

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%202.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%202.png)

- Higher frequency → Shorter Spatial Pulse Length → Better axial resolution.
- Higher frequency → Decrease in Depth.
- Narrow beam width → better lateral resolution.

## **Focusing:**

- Focusing of the transducer crystal → better lateral resolution → worsened axial resolution.

## **A-Mode Ultrasound:**

- Amplitude-mode → depth of an organ, organ's dimensions.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image12.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/image12.png)

## **M-mode Ultrasound:**

- Similar to A-mode
- Plotted over time → changes of motion.

## **Real Time Scanning:**

- Replaced B-mode
- Image continuously formed

## Transducer:

## **Types of Transducers:**

- Linear Array Transducer → high frequency → better for superficial structures → 5-10MHz
- Curvilinear Array Transducer → low frequency → abdominal examination → 2.5-5MHz
- Phased Array Transducer → low frequency → cardiac examination → 2-8MHz

## Ultrasound Images:

- The soft-tissue layers that can be visualized by ultrasound include the [epidermis](https://www.notion.so/Basic-Ultrasound-Concepts-ed8e2717543f453ab881057802b413d6#fe002323b3174991b1d78dcba8f2e439)/[dermis](https://www.notion.so/Basic-Ultrasound-Concepts-ed8e2717543f453ab881057802b413d6#32b2851651254df1a7d2c23bc0914e96), [subcutaneous layer](subcutaneous layer), [fascia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fascia), muscle, and bone.

### Epidermis

- The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis (subcutaneous tissue not part of skin).

### Dermis

- The dermis is anatomically divided into the papillary dermis (uppermost part of the dermis lying beneath the epidermis) and reticular dermis (a layer located under the papillary dermis).
- The papillary dermis constitutes circa 20% of the dermis and contains blood vessels and irregularly arranged thin collages and elastin fibers.
- The reticular dermis constitutes approximately 80% of the dermis. The collagen, elastin and reticular fibers are arranged regularly.

### Echogenicity:

- In terms of [Echogenicity](Terms/Echogenicity.md), the dermis is a heterogeneous layer with hyperechoic reflections of the collagen fibers and hypoechoic ones originating from the extracellular matrix that lies between the collagen fibers.

## **High Resolution Ultrasound Dermal Imaging:**

- The top reflection off the epidermis is a strong reflection. This represents the [stratum corneum](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stratum_corneum). Directly beneath this hard reflection is a very much less reflective that represents the [stratum malpighii](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Malpighian_layer) or area of living cells of the epidermis.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2019.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2019.png)

- Directly beneath this is the papillary layer of the dermis. This shows a homogenous pattern of moderately dense structure. The reticular layer of dermis is beneath the papillary layer. It has a slightly greater density with small highly reflective strips throughout. The dermis may have several lucent areas passing through it. These represent hair follicles or glandular structures.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2020.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2020.png)

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2021.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2021.png)

- Directly below the dermis is a hard reflection that represents the dermal-hypodermal boundary.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2022.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2022.png)

- Subcutaneous tissue (Hypodermis): The reflective patterns of the deeper tissue will vary by the anatomy found in the imaged area. Structures such as blood vessels, glands, fascia and adipose tissue can be identified.

## Subcutaneous Tissue (Hypodermis):

- The subcutaneous tissue layer, It acts as a passageway for the nerves and blood vessels from the dermis to the muscles and helps to protect the bones and muscles from damage.
- Subcutaneous tissue appears on sonography as a hypoechoic layer mostly composed of hypoechoic fatty lobules separated by hyperechoic linear fibrous septa.

## Muscle Layer:

- Skeletal Muscle "voluntary muscle"
- Smooth Muscle "involuntary muscle"—> e.g **Arrector Pili Muscle** - This is a tiny muscle that attaches to the base of a hair follicle at one end and to dermal tissue on the other end. In order to generate heat when the body is cold, the **Arrector Pili** Muscles contract all at once, causing the hair to "stand up straight" on the skin.

![Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2030.png](Basic%20Ultrasound%20Concepts/Untitled%2030.png)

- Cardiac Muscle "involuntary muscle" but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle.
