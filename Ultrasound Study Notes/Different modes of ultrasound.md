# Different modes of ultrasound

- **A-mode**: A-mode (**amplitude** mode) is the simplest type of ultrasound. A single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. [Therapeutic ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_ultrasound) aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy.
- **B-mode or 2D mode**: In B-mode (**brightness** mode) ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. More commonly known as 2D mode now.

    **B-flow** is a mode that digitally highlights moving reflectors (mainly [red blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell)) while suppressing the signals from the surrounding stationary tissue. It can visualize flowing blood and surrounding stationary tissues simultaneously.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound#cite_note-WangChou2005-31) It is thus an alternative or complement to [Doppler ultrasonography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_ultrasonography) in visualizing blood flow.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound#cite_note-Wachsberg2007-32)

- **C-mode**: A C-mode image is formed in a plane normal to a B-mode image. A gate that selects data from a specific depth from an A-mode line is used; then the transducer is moved in the 2D plane to sample the entire region at this fixed depth. When the transducer traverses the area in a spiral, an area of 100 cm can be scanned in around 10 seconds.
- **M-mode**: In M-mode (motion mode) ultrasound, pulses are emitted in quick succession – each time, either an A-mode or B-mode image is taken. Over time, this is analogous to recording a [video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video) in ultrasound. As the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe, this can be used to determine the velocity of specific organ structures.
- **[Doppler mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_ultrasonography)**: This mode makes use of the Doppler effect in measuring and visualizing blood flow
    - **Color Doppler**: Velocity information is presented as a color-coded overlay on top of a B-mode image
    - **Continuous wave (CW) Doppler**: Doppler information is sampled along a line through the body, and all velocities detected at each time point are presented (on a time line)
    - **Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler**: Doppler information is sampled from only a small sample volume (defined in 2D image), and presented on a timeline
    - **[Duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_ultrasonography)**: a common name for the simultaneous presentation of 2D and (usually) PW Doppler information. (Using modern ultrasound machines, color Doppler is almost always also used; hence the alternative name **Triplex**.)

- **Pulse inversion mode**: In this mode, two successive pulses with opposite sign are emitted and then subtracted from each other. This implies that any linearly responding constituent will disappear while gases with non-linear compressibility stand out. Pulse inversion may also be used in a similar manner as in **Harmonic mode**; see below:
- **Harmonic mode**: In this mode a deep penetrating fundamental frequency is emitted into the body and a [harmonic overtone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_imaging_microscopy) is detected. This way noise and artifacts due to reverberation and aberration are greatly reduced. Some also believe that penetration depth can be gained with improved lateral resolution; however, this is not well documented.
