Notes for the International Summer School on Advanced Ultrasound Imaging by Jørgen Arendt Jensen

## Three different kinds of images (P40)

acquired by multi-element array transducers - linear, convex, and phased.

Aperture

Some structures are smaller than the wavelength of ultrasound and thus cannot be visualized directly. But the strength of the signal (speckles, due to constructive and destructive interference of scattered signals) is an indication of pathology.
